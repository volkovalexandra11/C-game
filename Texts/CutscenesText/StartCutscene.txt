-Your Majesty?

-All things have a beginning and an end, my loyal Knight.

We've recieved reports from our scouts that the North has been devastated by those damn rebels!

After 30 years of rebellion, we have made no significant advances against them despite all the measures undertaken by the Holy Royal Inquisition!

Rebels' latest attack on our legions has turned the beatiful valleys of mine into a merciless thug teeming wasteland!

For this affront, they have to pay.

The word has reached us that the toll they've taken in the attack is enormous. Rebels are still recovering from their wounds in those cowards' hideout beyond the Undead Castle.

It is my chance! Knight! Hear me!

I, your King, hereby order you to bring justice to the North!

Slaugther each and every only of those pigs in a manner which is befitting of them!

Off you go!

Do not return without the head of their pesky leader in your bag!
