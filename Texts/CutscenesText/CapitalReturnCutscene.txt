“Your majesty! The rebellion is no more!” – those words brought cheers to the court of the high power.

The knight entered the throne room, with the rebels’ leader head in one hand and a scroll with his reforms proposals in another.

However, declaring them caused an arrogant mockery of the crowd.

“Never! My power is absolute! My will be done! “– the king exclaimed.

Knight’s hope disappeared in a moment, and contempt took its place.

He thought: “What is the point of serving a king if there is no strive to go forward in his deeds?”

No.

He could not take it.

A sharp sound of the sword drawn from his sheath spread around the room.

The King, a powerful magician, used his powers to manipulate walls of the castle in order to kill a single person.

The battle has begun.
